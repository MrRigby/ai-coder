# Specification template
> Ingest the information from this file, implement Low-Level Tasks and generate the code that will satisfy the High- and Mid-Level Objectives.

## High-Level Objective

- [High-Level goal goes here - what do you want to build?]

## Mid-Level Objectives

- [List of mid-Level Objectives - what are the steps to achieve the High-Level Objective?]
- [Each Mid-Level Objective should be concrete and measurable]
- [But not too detailed - that is for Implementation Notes and Low-Level Tasks]

## Implementation Notes

- [Important technical details - what are they?]
- [Dependencies and requirements - what are they?]
- [Coding standards to follow]
- [Other technical guidance]

## Context

### Beginning context
- List of files that exist at start

### Ending context
- List of files that will exist at end

## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish

1. [Task 1 - What is a first task?]
```claude
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What are the details you want to add to drive the code changes?
```
2. [Task 2 - What is a second task?]
```claude
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What are the details you want to add to drive the code changes?
```
3. [Task 3 - What is a third task?]
```claude
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE?
What are the details you want to add to drive the code changes?
```
